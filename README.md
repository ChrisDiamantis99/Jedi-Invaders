# Jedi Invaders
Jedi Invaders is a classic arcade-style game that takes inspiration from the popular game Space Invaders but with a Jedi theme. In this game, you play as a Jedi Knight defending the galaxy from an army of evil Sith invaders.

## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemy ships before they reach the bottom of the screen. The player controls a Jedi Knight at the bottom of the screen, moving horizontally and firing lasers upwards to destroy the enemy ships.

The game consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty. The enemy ships move faster and become harder to defeat as you progress through the levels. There are also boss battles at the end of each level, where you must defeat a powerful Sith Lord to advance to the next level.
